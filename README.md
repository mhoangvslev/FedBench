## A Benchmark Suite for Federated Semantic Data Query Processing
FedBench is a comprehensive benchmark suite for testing and analyzing both the efficiency and effectiveness of federated query processing on semantic data. The major challenge of such a benchmark lies in the heterogeneity of semantic data use cases, where applications may face different settings at both the data and query level, such as varying data access interfaces, incomplete knowledge about data sources, availability of different statistics, and varying degrees of query expressiveness. Accounting for this heterogeneity, we provide a highly flexible benchmark suite that can be customized to test a variety of use cases and compare competing approaches.
