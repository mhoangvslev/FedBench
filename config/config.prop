###
# baseDir
#	the base directory for the execution, i.e. the base path for any
#   location that is specified relatively
#
#   default: the current directory (=execution dir)
#    
#baseDir = D:\\Programming\\workspace\\fluidops\\EvalBenchmark\\


###
# querySet
#   the querySet for this evaluation, i.e. 
#   ALL -> all datasets
#   SIMPLE -> queries/simple
#   CUSTOM1 -> queries/custom
#   CROSSDOMAIN -> queries/cross-domain
#
#	query sets can be combinated using comma as separator
#	default: ALL
#
querySet = SIMPLE

###
# dataConfig
#   the data configuration file, location rel. to baseDir
#   
#   see doc/sampleConfig for some configuration possibilities
#
#dataConfig = config\\demoFederatedSparql.ttl
dataConfig = config/demoFederatedSparql.ttl



###
# showResults
#   true/false - flag to print the results to stdout
#
#   debugMode must be enabled
showResults = false


###
# debugMode
#   true/false - flag to enable debug mode
#
#   in the debug mode the query is evaluated only once, optionally
#   results can be printed (see showResults)
debugMode = false


###
# evalRuns
#
#   integer value representing the number of runs to perform
#   in each run all selected queries are executed
evalRuns = 2


###
# fill
#   true/false - flag to enable fill mode
#
#   in the fill mode no queries are evaluated
#   fill mode must be enabled if you want to fill a local native repository
#   fill mode can also be enabled using the program argument "-fill"
fill = false


###
# timeout
#   integer value representing the number of ms until a timeout occurs
#   0 means that timeouts are disabled (=default)
#
#   debugMode must be turned off
timeout = 0


###
# reportStream
#   fully qualified class name of the ReportStream to be used
#
#   available default implementations (pckg: org.semanticweb.fbench.report)
#     - SimplePrintStream -> print to stdout
#     - CsvReportStream -> print result and load times into csv files
#     - CombinedReportStream -> combination of the above Streams
#	  - RdfReportStream -> generates RDF triples in N3 syntax
#	  - CsvRdfReportStream -> RDF + CSV2 report
#	  - CsvReportStream2 -> print result into more intuitive csv file
#     
#   Default values:
#     - in debug mode: SimplePrintStream
#     - otherwise: CsvRdfReportStream
#reportStream = org.semanticweb.fbench.report.CombinedReportStream
reportStream = org.semanticweb.fbench.report.CsvRdfReportStream


###
# envConfig
#	location of the environment properties used in RdfReportStream
#
#   default: config\\env.prop
envConfig = config/env.prop


###
# evaluationClass
#   the fully qualified class name of the Evaluation to be used
#
#   Evaluation is an abstract class, custom implementations can be
#   used to extend functionality or to customize
#
#   Currently an implementation for Sesame is available (=default)
#	Also: SesameSparqlEvaluation => starts local sparql servers if necessary
evaluationClass = org.semanticweb.fbench.evaluation.SesameSparqlEvaluation


###
# earlyResultsMonitorClass
#	the fully qualified class name of the EarlyResultsMonitor to be used.
#
# 	EarlyResultsMonitor is an interface that can be used to measure the 
#	performance of early results.
#
#	Default: org.semanticweb.fbench.report.NoOpEarlyResultsMonitor
# earlyResultsMonitorClass = org.semanticweb.fbench.report.PrintEarlyResultsMonitor


###
# proxyUrl
#	the proxyUrl setting, i.e. (if specified) the url which shall be used
#	as proxy for HTTP SPARQL requests. Refer to SPARQLProvider for
#	some further information
#
#	This feature is tested with the provided Jetty Proxy, which acts transparently
#	and forwards requests according to the following scheme. 
#
# 	http://localhost:2000/http://myEndpoint.com:80/sparql
#
# 	In the above example the request is forwarded to 
#	http://myEndpoint.com:80/sparql. Note that in the general case
#   this URL is urlEncoded.
#
#proxyUrl = http://localhost:2000/


###
# description
#   a short description for this benchmark. The description is used in RdfReportStream
#   when benchmark mode is activated. This description is shown in the information
# 	workbench when the result is published.
#
#	Example description: Endpoint Federation (Sesame) Cross Domain Queries
#  
# 
description = Benchmark using Sesame Framework


###
# sparqlRequestReport
#	 boolean flag indicating whether the number of requests sent to the endpoint
#    shall be reported per query (see SparqlQueryRequestReport). Note that this
#	 report works only for local SPARQL endpoints (SparqlServlet2) and the evaluation
#	 class SesameSparqlEvaluation
#  	
#	 true: report stats to result\sparql_stats.csv
#  	 false: disabled
#
#  	 default false
#sparqlRequestReport = true


###
# sparqlRequestDelay
#   the delay in ms, which is added to each sparql request. Note that this configuration (if enabled) 
#   works only with local SPARQL server, since the property is added in SPARQLServlet2, i.e. it is 
# 	given as argument to the automatically started servers. 
# 	
#	Default is -1 (disabled)
#sparqlRequestDelay=-1
